Understanding your focal adhesion alignment index results

This folder contains all the intermediate files used to calculate the focal
adhesion alignement index for the image data set you submitted. There are three
primary folders:

    -individual_pictures: contains the results of processing the images from
     your movie, one image per folder.
    -adhesion_props: contains the files used to calculate the overall alignment
     index
    -errors: contains any errors produced during the image processing and
     analysis steps

You can check the results of the segmentation step by opening up a single image
folder inside "individual_pictures" and looking at "highlights.png". You can
also check to see which adhesions passed the major/minor axis ratio filter by
looking at the "ratio_highlight.png" image. The green adhesions were at or
above the ratio cutoff, while the red adhesions were below the cutoff (yellow
for passed and blue for removed with the color blind option).

There are also several files in the top level directory:
   
    -Exp Note.txt: contains the note you left yourself at the experiment submission screen
    -exp_settings.cfg: contains the specific settings used to process your data
    -FAAI.txt: contains the value of the FAAI
